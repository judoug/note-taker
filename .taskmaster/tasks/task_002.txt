# Task ID: 2
# Title: Integrate Clerk Authentication
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Add Clerk for authentication with email, Google, and GitHub providers. Set up sign-up, login, and session management.
# Details:
Install `@clerk/nextjs` and follow Clerk's Next.js App Router integration guide. Configure ClerkProvider in `layout.tsx`. Add sign-in and sign-up routes using Clerk's drop-in components. Set up environment variables from Clerk dashboard. Protect routes using Clerk middleware in `middleware.ts`.

# Test Strategy:
Sign up and log in with email and Google/GitHub. Verify session persistence and protected route access. Check user context is available.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Install Clerk Dependencies [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install the @clerk/nextjs package in the Next.js project to enable Clerk authentication features.
### Details:
Run 'npm install @clerk/nextjs' in the project root. Ensure the package is added to package.json and node_modules.

## 2. Configure ClerkProvider in Layout [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Set up the ClerkProvider in the main layout file to initialize Clerk across the application.
### Details:
Import ClerkProvider from '@clerk/nextjs' and wrap the application's root layout (e.g., layout.tsx) with it to provide authentication context.

## 3. Set Up Clerk Environment Variables [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Configure environment variables required by Clerk using values from the Clerk dashboard.
### Details:
Add Clerk frontend and backend API keys, and any OAuth provider secrets (Google, GitHub) to the .env.local file as per Clerk documentation.

## 4. Add Sign-In and Sign-Up Routes [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2, 2.3
### Description: Create dedicated routes for user sign-in and sign-up using Clerk's recommended structure.
### Details:
Add /sign-in and /sign-up routes (or folders) in the app directory, preparing them for Clerk's drop-in components.

## 5. Integrate Clerk Drop-In Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.4
### Description: Embed Clerk's SignIn and SignUp components into the respective routes for authentication UI.
### Details:
Import and render <SignIn /> and <SignUp /> components from '@clerk/nextjs' in the sign-in and sign-up route files.

## 6. Implement Route Protection with Middleware [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2, 2.3
### Description: Set up Clerk middleware to protect application routes and enforce authentication.
### Details:
Create or update middleware.ts to use Clerk's authMiddleware, specifying protected routes and configuring redirects for unauthenticated users.

## 7. Test Authentication Flows and Session Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.5, 2.6
### Description: Verify that sign-up, login, OAuth, session persistence, and protected routes function as expected.
### Details:
Test email, Google, and GitHub sign-in/sign-up. Confirm session persistence, user context availability, and that protected routes are inaccessible without authentication.
