# Task ID: 6
# Title: Design Notes Library UI
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 4, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Build the main notes dashboard with list view, search, and filters.
# Details:
Implement a responsive notes list using Tailwind CSS. Show note title, preview, and tags. Add a search bar and filter controls for date, tags, and AI tags. Use React Query (or SWR) for data fetching and caching.

# Test Strategy:
Verify notes display correctly for different users. Test search and filter interactions. Check responsiveness and Figma alignment.
