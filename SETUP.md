# AI Note Taker Setup Instructions

## Environment Variables Setup

To complete the Clerk authentication setup, you need to create a `.env.local` file in the project root with the following variables:

### 1. Create `.env.local` file:

```bash
# In the project root directory, create .env.local with these contents:

# Clerk Authentication Keys
# Get these from https://dashboard.clerk.com/
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_publishable_key_here
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here

# Clerk URL Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_FORCE_REDIRECT_URL=/dashboard
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_FORCE_REDIRECT_URL=/dashboard

# OpenAI API Key (for later tasks)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Database URL (for NeonDB - will be added in Task 3)
DATABASE_URL=your_neondb_connection_string_here
```

### 2. Get Clerk Keys:

1. Go to [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/)
2. Create a new application or select existing one
3. Go to "API Keys" section
4. Copy the "Publishable key" and "Secret key"
5. Replace the placeholder values in your `.env.local` file

### 3. Configure OAuth Providers (Optional):

In the Clerk Dashboard:
1. Go to "User & Authentication" â†’ "Social Connections"
2. Enable Google and/or GitHub OAuth
3. Configure with your OAuth app credentials

## Testing Authentication:

Once `.env.local` is created with proper Clerk keys:

1. **Start Development Server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test Authentication Flow:**
   - Visit `http://localhost:3000` - Should show landing page with Sign Up/Sign In buttons
   - Click "Sign Up" - Should redirect to `/sign-up` with Clerk registration form
   - Create account with email/Google/GitHub
   - After sign-up, should redirect to `/dashboard` (protected route)
   - Verify user info displays and UserButton works for sign-out
   - Test sign-in flow at `/sign-in`
   - Verify middleware protection: try accessing `/dashboard` without authentication

3. **Build Test:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   Will fail during static generation until environment variables are set, but this confirms the authentication integration is complete.

## Next Steps:

Authentication setup is complete! The next tasks will be:
- Task 3: Set Up NeonDB and Prisma ORM
- Task 4: Sync Clerk Users with Database
